About Me

Hello, I'm Jahnavi Prudhivi, double majoring in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). 
My passion revolves around the fusion of Artificial Intelligence into Robotics fields such as Humanoid, Swarm and Soft Robotics as well as Computer Vision
and Perception. My research, work and projects I have accomplished reflects my extensive abilities in these and many other fields. My continued research will 
ultimately expand my knowledge and allow for me to apply these skills into solving real-world problems, including combining programming, electrical and
mechanical aspects
