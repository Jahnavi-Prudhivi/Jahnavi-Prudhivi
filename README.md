# About Me

Hello, I'm Jahnavi Prudhivi, double majoring in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). 
My passion revolves around the fusion of Artificial Intelligence into Robotics fields such as Humanoid, Swarm and Soft Robotics as well as Computer Vision
and Perception. My research, work and projects I have accomplished reflects my extensive abilities in these and many other fields. My continued research will 
ultimately expand my knowledge and allow for me to apply these skills into solving real-world problems, including combining programming, electrical and
mechanical aspects

# Education
Worcester Polytechnic Institute | Class of 2026 | 3.75 (`<br>`)
Robotics Engineering (BSE) & Computer Science (BS)

# Experience
**Robotics Material Research Group** [WPI] [Sept 2023 - Present] (`<br>`)
**Position**: Researcher (`<br>`)
- Collaborating with Ph.D. students to develop 3D printable robots capable of withstanding substantial structural deformations, disabling conventional approaches to computing and control
- Implementing systematic strategies for the rapid design, fabrication, and deployment of highly customized robot fleets for urgent missions involving aerial, ground, and underwater robot
- Exploring mechanical intelligence, embedded fluidic circuits, and flexible electronics to combat obstacles and debris fields 
Using Bambu Lab, PRUSA, SolidWorks, and Fusion360, to facilitate the design and production processes

**Music, Perception, and Robotics Laboratory** [WPI] [Oct 2023 - Present]  (`<br>`)
**Position**: Researcher(`<br>`)
Current Project: Robotic Percussion Performance with Advanced Actuators
- Designing and developing a modular percussion instrument arm with the use of complex actuators including voice coils and multi-DOF arms
- Building expressive systems unique to machines, humans, and their intersection while blending technology and art using human musical perception
- Conducting psychological research that examines human musical perception and creativity, and improving productivity in the synergy between robotics and human performances

**ASSISTments** [WPI] [Feb 2023 - May 2023](`<br>`)
**Position**: AI Project Worker(`<br>`)
Analyzed studentsâ€™ math homework uploaded to a digital platform and annotated over 100,000 images for PIIS to develop machine-learning methods to detect and remove PIIS and build various image processing models to strip the PII in the rest of the image set.
